## Refactoring or Improvement

If I have more time: 
- I would add a handler depending on the type of file being uploaded, 
be it json, csv or doc.
- I don't like the error handling mechanism and passing it to the session, I would sit here and think of a solution.
- The response would have been done through resources.
- Code style check and lint.
- Would add Meaningful tests.
- Would provide API docs and install swagger doc.
